# Sweet-Date – A Headless Calendar Engine. 
> **Funding Proposal – Early Stage Concept**  
> This page presents an early-stage proposal for **Sweet-Date**, an open-source, headless calendar engine designed to support European values of openness, **GDPR** compliance, privacy, and interoperability.

## What Is Sweet-Date?

Sweet-Date is a modular, headless, GDPR compliant, calendar backend designed to be integrated into modern applications.

It exposes a simple command-based protocol for managing calendars, events, and availability — similar in spirit to how systems like Redis or MinIO provide a structured interface for external clients.

Sweet-Date is not a calendar API, UI component, or file format like iCalendar or WebCal. Instead, it is a backend engine with a command-based protocol that defines how calendar functionality is structured and accessed. While support for standards like iCalendar could be added in the future, Sweet-Date focuses on behavior and system design — not data serialization or external API compatibility.

## Who Is It For

SaaS providers and software projects that require robust, full-featured calendar functionality as part of their core offering.

Developers, system architects, and product teams looking for a backend-first calendar engine they can fully control and integrate into their infrastructure.

## Why Sweet-Date?

Most calendar infrastructure is built into closed platforms — tightly coupled to proprietary APIs, limited in flexibility, and deeply integrated with the vendor’s data ecosystem. This leaves developers with little control, users with limited data ownership, and organizations dependent on opaque third-party services.

Sweet-Date is built as an independent, backend-first alternative. The goal is to provide a standalone calendar engine that can be deployed anywhere, extended as needed, and integrated directly into existing systems — without giving up ownership, transparency, or technical control.

Where CalDAV defines a protocol and leaves the implementation to developers, Sweet-Date provides a ready-to-use backend and client libraries — so integration is immediate and implementation overhead is minimal.
