# Funding Supports and How the Project Will Grow

##  What the Initial Funding Supports

The goal of initial funding is to take SweetDate — a proof-of-concept headless calendar engine — and bring it to a production-ready state. Funding will support:

- A robust, extensible **core SweetDate engine** with support for events, calendars, invitations, reminders, and tagging
- **Standardized JSON protocol definitions** for interoperability across language clients
- Official **client libraries** for Ruby, JavaScript, and Elixir
- A public **documentation site** and protocol explorer (via `clp_docs`)
- A **code generation tool** to streamline building new clients or integrations
- Example projects and **starter kits** to showcase SweetDate usage across different tech stacks
- A hosted test server to test up against 

## Ongoing Hosting & Tooling Costs

Funding will also cover the essential infrastructure to ensure SweetDate remains accessible and usable:

- **Demo/test hosting** of the SweetDate engine on Hetzner, or a simular bare meteal server.
- **CI pipelines** and automated tests of the SweetDate engine and client.
- **Public Portal** for registration and generation of credential, needed for the hosted demo.
- **Project management and community support** Hosted git repo. Slack channel, Domain Name Server.

These costs are modest but essential for creating a trustworthy developer experience.

## Long-Term Plans for Sustainability

SweetDate will remain fully **open source and free** to self-host and extend. To ensure long-term development and ecosystem growth, we plan to support the project through:

### Paid Developer & Integration Services
- Hosted SweetDate instances (e.g. single-tenant on Heroku or Fly.io)
- Integration support for companies building scheduling, booking, or event tools
- SLA-backed support and onboarding packages for small dev teams or startups

### Enterprise Offering
- Multi-tenant deployments with organization-level controls
- Bridges to external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Exchange, CalDAV)
- Compliance features and dedicated hosting

### Public/Private Funding and Donations
- Applying for **EU grants** (NGI Zero, Sovereign Tech Fund, Digital Europe)
- Community contributions and **Open Collective**-style funding
- Exploring dual licensing only if future demand arises for private extensions
