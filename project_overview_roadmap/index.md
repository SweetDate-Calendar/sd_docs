# Project Overview & Roadmap

This page outlines the broader scope of the SweetDate project — not just as a backend calendar engine, but as a fully-fledged open infrastructure stack for calendar functionality.

SweetDate aims to provide a complete, developer-first foundation for calendar systems, including a protocol definition format, CLI tooling, language-specific clients, hosted services, and supporting documentation. This roadmap is intended to guide development, coordinate contributions, and support funding efforts.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation (Now → Q3 2025)

- [x] Build working proof of concept for core calendar backend
- [x] Create initial Ruby client and CLI scaffolding prototype
- [x] Launch project documentation site (this site)
- [ ] Finalize core protocol schema (YAML)
- [ ] Generate clients from spec using CLI

### Phase 2 – Public Demo & Feedback Loop (Q3–Q4 2025)

- [ ] Launch hosted demo with access key registration
- [ ] Support Elixir client via CLI
- [ ] Validate real-world usage and edge cases
- [ ] Open up protocol for public feedback and proposals

### Phase 3 – Community and Ecosystem (2026+)

- [ ] Establish open governance model for protocol changes
- [ ] Add support for other languages (JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- [ ] Host community calls or contributor syncs
- [ ] Seek sustainable funding and long-term maintenance model
